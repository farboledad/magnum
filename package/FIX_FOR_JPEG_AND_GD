Hey Franco,

Part 2:
Once it fails building ‘gd’, make the following changes
-	Remove ‘build_dir/target-arm_v5te_uClibc-0.9.30.3_eabi/gd-2.0.35/libtool’ and link (or copy) the one from ‘staging_dir/host/bin/libtool’ (the same as what libjpeg almost did right , but for this package we cannot do this in the prepare step of the openwrt makefile since the autoconfig will remove it again)
-	In the generated ‘makefile target../gd-…/Makefile’ change
LIBICONV = @LIBICONV@
to
LIBICONV = 
And
LTLIBICONV = @LTLIBICONV@
To
LTLIBICONV = 

That should do the trick to build libgd
With these changes I am able to build vnstat.

Regards

PS: Quote from the openWRT wiki:
Some/many packages that think autotools is a good idea end up needing "fixes" to work around autotools "accidentally" knowing better and using host tools instead of the build environment tools

Hey Franco,

The full chain for vnstat still doesn’t compile, but I want to give you the pointer to get lipjpeg compiled.

You do NOT want to use the libtool from “dummy” but  from staging/host/bin (you also do not need to copy anything)

1)
In ‘package/feeds/packages/jpeg/Makefile’ make the flowing change
ln -s $(STAGING_DIR)/host/bin/libtool libtool; \
to
ln -s $(STAGING_DIR)/../host/bin/libtool libtool; \
: it seems like an issue in the jpeg package makefile ? (maybe more recent openwrt versions have it install there ? )

2)
then in staging_dir/host/bin/libtool
CC="i686-linux-gnu-gcc"
to
CC="arm-openwrt-linux-uclibcgnueabi-gcc"
Ps: this is what will do the trick, but I don’t know the most elegant solution for it. I think it is a general issue in libtool, because it can find the correct command by itself, but not if you specifiy an –rpath entry …
I found a post about this issue http://www.metastatic.org/text/libtool.html

But then lib gd will fail … still need to figure out what is going on there

Regards
Tom
